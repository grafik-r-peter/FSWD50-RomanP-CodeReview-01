/// FSWD50-RomanP-CodeReview-01 ///


Hey there! 

With the exception of the Navi the whole site should be responsive. 
Even though its a bit ugly at times and could use refinement. 

I hope you guys are alright with my use of flexbox. 
To be honest, I never used it before so i hope i didnt make too many crucial mistakes. 

I tried to describe the code with comments as well. 

Let me know if something is unclear. 

See you, Roman
